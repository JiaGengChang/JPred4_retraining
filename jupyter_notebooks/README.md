# Jupyter notebooks
* Explanation of subdirectories below:

<br>

### alphafold
Comparison of alphafold vs Jpred performance, and alignment stuff

### databases
One notebook of requests to Jnet database. More are in `JGC_jpred/scripts`

### machine_learning
Notebooks and scripts for neural network training. The main one is `HMM_cross_val...`. Those starting with `joint-cv...` are experimental.

### model_evaluation
Notebooks to compare prediction accuracy and segment overlap score of keras and SNNS networks

### preprocessing
Some old files when I was experimenting how to manipulate profile HMMs and PSSM matrices. Can probably archive.

### visualization
Notebooks to visualize training/validation curves and scatterplots.

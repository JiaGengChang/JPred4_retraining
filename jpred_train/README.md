# JNet training code

The code here is obtained and modified from:

* `/cluster/gjb_lab/adrozdetskiy/Projects/Jpred/www-jpred/training/trunk/`

To run the code, you must first install a few perl modules including DBI (to query the Jnet database) and SNNS (to which neural network training jobs are submitted).
